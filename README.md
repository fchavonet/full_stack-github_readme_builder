# GitHub README Builder

## Description

GitHub README Builder is an interactive web application that lets users compose, preview, and export professional README.md files for GitHub repositories.

It features a live Markdown editor, predefined content blocks, custom badge generation, and a real-time preview styled with GitHub-like formatting.

## Objectives

- Provide a user-friendly Markdown editor focused on GitHub READMEs.
- Enable quick insertion of structured sections (titles, objectives, tech stack...).
- Render live previews with GitHub-like styling.
- Offer badge generation using [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) and [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/).
- Improve DOM manipulation and UI/UX handling using vanilla JavaScript.
